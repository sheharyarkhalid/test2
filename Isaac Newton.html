        <p style="text-align: center; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;"> Never the humble sort, he would have found the date apt: The gift to humanity and science had arrived. Just 23 years later, with his alma mater Cambridge University and much of England closed due to plague, Newton discovered the laws that now bear his name.(He had to invent a new kind of math along the way: calculus). The introverted English scholar held off on publishing those findings for decades, though, and it took the Herculean efforts of friend and comet discoverer Edmund Halley to get Newton to publish. The only reason Halley knew of Newton's work? A bet the former had with other scientists on the nature of planetary orbits. When Halley mentioned the orbital problem to him, Newton shocked his friend by giving the answer immediately, having long ago worked it out. Halley persuaded Newton to publish his calculations, and the results were the Philosophi Naturalis Principia Mathematica, or just the Principia, in 1687. 
            <br><br>
            Not only did it describe for the first time how the planets moved through space and how projectiles on Earth traveled through the air; the Principia showed that the same fundamental force, gravity, governs both. Newton united the heavens and the Earth with his laws. Thanks to him, scientists believed they had a chance of unlocking the universe's secrets. He would only really leave his room to give lectures even to empty rooms."Ofttimes he did in a manner, for want of hearers, read to the walls," Humphrey wrote in 1727. It would take too long to list his other scientific achievements, but the greatest hits might include his groundbreaking work on light and color; his development and refinement of reflecting telescopes ; and other fundamental work in math and heat. He also dabbled in biblical prophecies (predicting the world's end in A.D. 2060), practiced alchemy and spent years trying, and failing, to produce the fabled philosopher's stone. Alas, even Newton's genius could not create the impossible. 
            <br><br>
            In 1692, this rare failure, along with the unraveling of one of his few close friendships and possibly mercury poisoning from his alchemical experiments resulted in what we would now call a prolonged nervous breakdown. Newton's science-producing days were over, for reasons known only to him, though he would remain influential in the field. After languishing on a professor's salary at Cambridge University for decades, in 1696 Newton received a cushy royal appointment to be Warden of the Mint in London. It was meant as an easy job with a nice paycheck: It "has not too much bus'nesse to require more attendance than you may spare," his friend Charles Montague wrote after landing him the job. After a promotion to Master of the Mint, he oversaw the recoinage of English currency, advised on economics, established the gold standard and replaced all the country's metal currency with improved, ridged coins , which made it harder to shave off bits of the precious metals. 
            <br>
            The man could nurse grudges for years, even after his foes had died. Newton also made it his life's work to torment English scientist Robert Hooke, destroying the legacy of a man once considered London's Leonardo da Vinci. How fitting that the unit of force is named after stubborn, persistent, amazing Newton, himself a force of nature.</p>

  <br><br>  <p style="text-align:center;width:100%;padding:0px 20px;"> The mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange said that Newton was the greatest genius who ever lived, and once added that Newton was also "the most fortunate, for we cannot find more than once a system of the world to establish". English poet Alexander Pope wrote the famous epitaph: Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night; God said "Let Newton be" and all was light. Newton was relatively modest about his achievements, writing in a letter to Robert Hooke in February 1676, stating "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants".Two writers think that the above quotation, written at a time when Newton and Hooke were in dispute over optical discoveries, was an oblique attack on Hooke (said to have been short and hunchbacked), rather than or in addition to a statement of modesty. On the other hand, the widely known proverb about standing on the shoulders of giants, published among others by seventeenth-century poet George Herbert (a former orator of the University of Cambridge and fellow of Trinity College) in his Jacula Prudentum , had as its main point that "a dwarf on a giant's shoulders sees farther of the two", and so its effect as an analogy would place Newton himself rather than Hooke as the wouldwarf'. 
            <br><br>
            In a later memoir, Newton wrote: I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me. In 1816, a tooth said to have belonged to Newton was sold for 730 in London to an aristocrat who had it set in a ring. Guinness World Records 2002 classified it as the most valuable tooth, which would value approximately 25,000 in late 2001. Who bought it and who currently has it has not been disclosed. Albert Einstein kept a picture of Newton on his study wall alongside ones of Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell. In a 2005 survey of members of Britain's Royal Society asking who had the greater effect on the history of science, Newton or Einstein, the members deemed Newton to have made the greater overall contribution. 
            <br><br>
            In 1999, an opinion poll of 100 of the day's leading physicists voted Einstein the "greatest physicist ever," with Newton the runner-up, while a parallel survey of rank-and-file physicists by the site PhysicsWeb gave the top spot to Newton. The SI derived unit of force is named the Newton in his honour.
